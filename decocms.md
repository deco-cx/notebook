# DecoCMS.com  --- Positioning & Messaging

1. One-Sentence Positioning

---

Headline (one-liner)

Deco is the home for all your AI apps.

Clarifier (immediately under it)

A generative control plane for data, tools, models, permissions, and memory --- so you can prototype in chat, ship in code, and run & monetize agentic apps in production.

Alt (analogy-first)

"As easy to start as a chat app, as programmable as a workflow engine---inside one governed admin."

---

2. Why Now

---

- Prompt → production gap: Non-technical teams can prototype, but production still needs policy, tenancy, logging, and cost governance.

- Context is the product: Winners standardize on a governed context gateway (connectors + policy + observability) that agents and UIs share.

- "AI app builders" ≠ ops: Many tools stop at pretty UIs. Companies need a runtime + control plane that's auditable, scalable, and extensible.

- Monetization missing: The long tail of internal agents needs distribution + per-run billing to sustain an ecosystem.

---

3. Category & Anchors

---

- Category:  Context CMS (open-source admin for AI agents)

- Problem: Prototypes are easy; production (governance, costs, observability) is hard

- Use case: Build, run, and monetize bespoke agentic apps on your own stack

- Alternative: Stitching model APIs + workflow tools + SaaS + DIY governance

- Persona: Web/TS devs & partner implementers; product/ops leaders

---

4. Problem (tight)

---

Shipping production agentic software is messy. Teams glue together auth, data access, model routing, logging, costs, and approvals across vendors. Prototypes stall or get buried under compliance.

Sub-problems

- Fragmented stack: LLMs here, workflows there, UI elsewhere

- Governance/RBAC/FinOps bolted on late

- "Vibe debugging" instead of repeatable ops

- No clean way to reuse or monetize components

---

5. Solution (what Deco is)

---

Deco is the Context Management System --- a control plane + runtime --- that unifies your agentic stack around your context.

- Context Mesh (MCP-native): connectors to data/tools/models with policy, auth, RBAC, audit, spend caps

- Unified runtime: compose agents, workflows, UIs in one repo; edge deploy; typed interfaces

- Dual surface:  prototype in chat, then harden/scale in code (SDK/CLI) without changing platforms

- Observability: logs, traces, error analytics, cost per step

- Marketplace + wallet: install or publish modules with one-click, per-run billing

- Packages: full "OSs" can live inside DecoCMS (e.g., Storefront Suite, former deco.cx)

---

6. Differentiation (how we're not "just another AI web app builder")

---

- Control plane for context (not only code generation): governed routing, policy, and observability

- Safe vibe coding: every run traced, every permission scoped, every cost capped

- One codebase, one deploy: agents/workflows/UIs together; no vendor sprawl

- Usage-based billing & monetization: build once, bill per run; transparent wallet billing

- Open-source & extensible: self-host/BYOK; forkable core; partner ecosystem

---

7. Promises (trust commitments)

---

- Production-safe by default: RBAC, audit trails, approvals, spend caps

- Portable & open: zero lock-in; your code, your data, your keys

- Prompt-to-production: chat prototypes become shippable software---same runtime

- Marketplace leverage: reuse what works; monetize what you create

---

8. Capability → Feature → Benefit

---

- Context Mesh → connectors + policy + RBAC → Right context at the right time---safely

- Unified runtime → typed RPC + edge deploy → Prototype and ship on the same stack---no rewrites

- Observability → logs & traces + cost per step → Operate with confidence; fix fast

- Governance → audit, approvals, spend caps → Pass compliance; control risk & cost

- Marketplace & wallet → one-click install; per-run billing → Reuse & monetize modules instantly

- Packages → e.g., Storefront Suite → End-to-end "OSs" inside the same admin

---

9. Single Story per Page (don't blend)

---

Story A --- Developers & Partners (/developers, GitHub)

H1: Open-source runtime for AI apps.

Sub: Build agents, workflows, and UIs in one repo; connect your stack; deploy to the edge; publish modules---without vendor sprawl.

Story B --- Teams & Founders (/teams or /founders)

H1: A single control plane for all your AI projects.

Sub: Prototype in chat, then hand off to engineers (yours or ours) to harden for production with roles, limits, audit, and clear costs.

---

10. Homepage Copy (clear version)

---

H1: The admin for your AI agents.

H2: Connect context → compose agents, workflows, and UIs → deploy, observe, and bill per run.

11. Elevator Pitches

---

General (45--60s)

AI made demos easy; production is where it breaks---permissions, logging, costs, and compliance are missing. DecoCMS is the admin for your AI agents: connect your context (data, tools, models, permissions, memory), compose agents/workflows/UIs, and run them in production with roles, audit, limits, and per-run billing. Prototype in chat, ship in code, and keep everything inside one governed admin. In 30 days, your first autonomous workflow goes live.

Investor-friendly (no jargon, 45--60s)

Next-gen companies won't win by renting bloated tools; they'll win by running software tailored to how they operate. DecoCMS turns a company's context into working automation---AI teammates and workflows that actually do the job. It's production-safe and extensible, with a marketplace so teams can install or sell modules with clear per-run billing. Customers ship a live workflow in a month and scale on their own terms.
