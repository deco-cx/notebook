Fizemos um redesign no  projeto mas ai o miolo que tinha antes ficou todo errado, sem margem, coisas em cima da outra e contraste (texto branco em botao branco)

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning layout changes**

I'm reviewing several files like Notebook.tsx, Cell.tsx, styles.css, and App.tsx. The user mentioned an issue with white text on a white button, which might stem from changes in Tailwind classes or CSS variables. I need to check the overall theme in index.html and the sidebar layout too. 

I'll create a todo list because this is a multi-step process: diagnose the layout, implement fixes, and ensure proper contrast and spacing. Following the guidance, I’ll provide status updates as I progress, but I won’t show any code to the user unless requested.
**Reading relevant files**

I'm diving into several files to gather the necessary information, including Notebook.tsx, Cell.tsx, styles.css, TipTapView.tsx, MonacoView.tsx, and layout components. I also need to check if button.tsx exists in the components/ui directory since it might be essential for our task. I wonder if any CSS tokens have changed in styles.css, as that might affect the layout too. Let’s proceed with this exploration to ensure I’m covering all bases!</details></think>

---

I'll scan the Notebook, Cell, and related view components plus the global styles to identify where spacing and contrast regressed, then implement layout and Tailwind class fixes.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Addressing layout issues**

I need to fix some layout and contrast issues after a redesign. The user wants me to analyze the layout and fix it according to the specifications in split.md, focusing on logic and UI separation. There are clear issues like elements overlapping and poor contrast (like white text on a white button). The provided CSS has many custom variables, but they aren't defined in :root, leading to potential fallback defaults. That can definitely cause the layout and contrast problems I'm seeing. I'll need to adjust margin and padding for better structure!
**Fixing CSS variables and styles**

I need to define the missing CSS variables that map to the tokens and adjust the padding and margins for the notebook container. I'll also check buttons with white text on white backgrounds since that could create visibility issues. The navigation button styling uses color variables, which could lead to wrong colors if not set properly. It’s essential to define the necessary mappings for background and text colors, plus border variables. I'll provide default values for both light and dark themes, and also fix hover colors for the navigation buttons to ensure good contrast!
**Defining border colors and contrast**

I’m considering defining the border-main as a bright green, like #00ff41. The challenge here is that using white text on such a green might not be ideal for contrast. In the past, they favored a "terminal" style with green, but I think black text would offer better visibility. I need to map the background to ensure the text stands out, especially since using white on neon green could make it hard to read. I’ll keep the design consistent while enhancing readability!
**Mapping CSS variables and spacing**

I need to clarify the default styles for the navigation button. Its background is likely transparent, and the text color could be undefined, leading to white on white issues. I’ll ensure that the primary text color maps to a defined darker variable. For the :root mapping, I’ll set various color variables like --bg-primary to --card and adjust secondary and muted variables. Additionally, I need to include spacing variables since their absence may lead to collapsed spacing. I'll handle similar adjustments for the dark theme as well!
**Defining spacing and implementing changes**

I figured out that the overlapping issue, or "coisas em cima da outra," needs addressing. I’ll define a spacing system with tokens like --spacing-xxs for 2px and going up to --spacing-xxl for 32px, all set in :root. I’ll also include backgrounds and font variables while updating styles.css to define missing maps and adjusting the notebook container to a max-width of 1100px with proper margins and padding. I'll ensure hover states for buttons are clear and follow the developer flow guidelines for statuses before tool calls. Let's get those changes implemented!</details></think>

I'm going to add missing CSS variables for spacing, colors, and backgrounds, and adjust the `notebook-container` to restore margins and spacing to fix overlapping and contrast issues. Then I'll re-run a quick lint check.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating CSS fixes**

We need to follow the tool flow, like updating statuses before calls and managing todos. I didn’t create todos this time—it’s more of a medium refactor but started as a minor fix. The user specifically asked to check the layout and fix spacing and contrast. We’ve mapped CSS variables and adjusted container settings. I might need to address button contrast since there was a complaint about white text on a white button.
**Reviewing CSS Variables**

In light mode, the ring color uses the oklch variable from earlier token definitions. It appears that the ring is treated as the primary dark color. The run-button's background will be dark, while its text turns nearly white for good contrast. The delete button inherits a muted text color and a transparent background, switching to red on hover.

I’ve also confirmed that other CSS variables are defined correctly. Now, I need to run the read_lints tool on the edited file.
**Finalizing Class Names and Spacing**

I need to make sure that `Notebook.tsx` uses the appropriate class names and confirms that top navigation classes are defined—good, they are. To fix the issue of "things on top of each other," I should check the spacing between sections. The padding and margin settings for top navigation, notebook header, and toolbar are already using the defined spacing variables—perfect!

The TipTap buttons look fine, and while I thought about updating the index.html background, it seems unnecessary right now. I’ll go ahead and run the lints.</details></think>

I updated legacy CSS variables and spacing tokens, restored a centered container with padding, and mapped all custom variables used by `Notebook`/`Cell` so margins and contrast work again. I'll check for linter issues on the changed stylesheet.

- I added missing CSS tokens and legacy variable aliases used by `Notebook`/`Cell`, and restored container spacing.
- The notebook area is now centered with margin and padding; header/toolbar/cell blocks regain spacing and proper contrast, fixing white-on-white buttons and overlapping.

Key edits:
```/view/src/styles.css
:root {
  /* added spacing scale, bg/text/border/accent aliases mapped to new tokens */
}
.notebook-container {
  /* set max-width, auto margins, padding */
}
```

If anything else still looks off, point me to the specific block and I’ll fine-tune those styles.
