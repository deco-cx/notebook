<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning layout changes**

I'm reviewing several files like Notebook.tsx, Cell.tsx, styles.css, and App.tsx. The user mentioned an issue with white text on a white button, which might stem from changes in Tailwind classes or CSS variables. I need to check the overall theme in index.html and the sidebar layout too. 

I'll create a todo list because this is a multi-step process: diagnose the layout, implement fixes, and ensure proper contrast and spacing. Following the guidance, I’ll provide status updates as I progress, but I won’t show any code to the user unless requested.
**Reading relevant files**

I'm diving into several files to gather the necessary information, including Notebook.tsx, Cell.tsx, styles.css, TipTapView.tsx, MonacoView.tsx, and layout components. I also need to check if button.tsx exists in the components/ui directory since it might be essential for our task. I wonder if any CSS tokens have changed in styles.css, as that might affect the layout too. Let’s proceed with this exploration to ensure I’m covering all bases!</details></think>

---

I'll scan the Notebook, Cell, and related view components plus the global styles to identify where spacing and contrast regressed, then implement layout and Tailwind class fixes.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Addressing layout issues**

I need to fix some layout and contrast issues after a redesign. The user wants me to analyze the layout and fix it according to the specifications in split.md, focusing on logic and UI separation. There are clear issues like elements overlapping and poor contrast (like white text on a white button). The provided CSS has many custom variables, but they aren't defined in :root, leading to potential fallback defaults. That can definitely cause the layout and contrast problems I'm seeing. I'll need to adjust margin and padding for better structure!
**Fixing CSS variables and styles**

I need to define the missing CSS variables that map to the tokens and adjust the padding and margins for the notebook container. I'll also check buttons with white text on white backgrounds since that could create visibility issues. The navigation button styling uses color variables, which could lead to wrong colors if not set properly. It’s essential to define the necessary mappings for background and text colors, plus border variables. I'll provide default values for both light and dark themes, and also fix hover colors for the navigation buttons to ensure good contrast!
**Defining border colors and contrast**

I’m considering defining the border-main as a bright green, like #00ff41. The challenge here is that using white text on such a green might not be ideal for contrast. In the past, they favored a "terminal" style with green, but I think black text would offer better visibility. I need to map the background to ensure the text stands out, especially since using white on neon green could make it hard to read. I’ll keep the design consistent while enhancing readability!
**Mapping CSS variables and spacing**

I need to clarify the default styles for the navigation button. Its background is likely transparent, and the text color could be undefined, leading to white on white issues. I’ll ensure that the primary text color maps to a defined darker variable. For the :root mapping, I’ll set various color variables like --bg-primary to --card and adjust secondary and muted variables. Additionally, I need to include spacing variables since their absence may lead to collapsed spacing. I'll handle similar adjustments for the dark theme as well!
**Defining spacing and implementing changes**

I figured out that the overlapping issue, or "coisas em cima da outra," needs addressing. I’ll define a spacing system with tokens like --spacing-xxs for 2px and going up to --spacing-xxl for 32px, all set in :root. I’ll also include backgrounds and font variables while updating styles.css to define missing maps and adjusting the notebook container to a max-width of 1100px with proper margins and padding. I'll ensure hover states for buttons are clear and follow the developer flow guidelines for statuses before tool calls. Let's get those changes implemented!</details></think>

---

I'm going to add missing CSS variables for spacing, colors, and backgrounds, and adjust the `notebook-container` to restore margins and spacing to fix overlapping and contrast issues. Then I'll re-run a quick lint check.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating CSS fixes**

We need to follow the tool flow, like updating statuses before calls and managing todos. I didn’t create todos this time—it’s more of a medium refactor but started as a minor fix. The user specifically asked to check the layout and fix spacing and contrast. We’ve mapped CSS variables and adjusted container settings. I might need to address button contrast since there was a complaint about white text on a white button.
**Reviewing CSS Variables**

In light mode, the ring color uses the oklch variable from earlier token definitions. It appears that the ring is treated as the primary dark color. The run-button's background will be dark, while its text turns nearly white for good contrast. The delete button inherits a muted text color and a transparent background, switching to red on hover.

I’ve also confirmed that other CSS variables are defined correctly. Now, I need to run the read_lints tool on the edited file.
**Finalizing Class Names and Spacing**

I need to make sure that `Notebook.tsx` uses the appropriate class names and confirms that top navigation classes are defined—good, they are. To fix the issue of "things on top of each other," I should check the spacing between sections. The padding and margin settings for top navigation, notebook header, and toolbar are already using the defined spacing variables—perfect!

The TipTap buttons look fine, and while I thought about updating the index.html background, it seems unnecessary right now. I’ll go ahead and run the lints.</details></think>

---

I updated legacy CSS variables and spacing tokens, restored a centered container with padding, and mapped all custom variables used by `Notebook`/`Cell` so margins and contrast work again. I'll check for linter issues on the changed stylesheet.

---



---

- I added missing CSS tokens and legacy variable aliases used by `Notebook`/`Cell`, and restored container spacing.
- The notebook area is now centered with margin and padding; header/toolbar/cell blocks regain spacing and proper contrast, fixing white-on-white buttons and overlapping.

Key edits:
```/view/src/styles.css
:root {
  /* added spacing scale, bg/text/border/accent aliases mapped to new tokens */
}
.notebook-container {
  /* set max-width, auto margins, padding */
}
```

If anything else still looks off, point me to the specific block and I’ll fine-tune those styles.

O select que tem Tip Tap Editor tá com problema de contraste também

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Addressing contrast issue in TipTap Editor**

I need to fix the contrast for the select element in the TipTap Editor, particularly found in the Cell.tsx file, lines 67-79. The current className has white text on a light background due to a transparent background. This results in poor visibility. The cell header uses a secondary background that can appear light in certain themes. I should adjust the styles to ensure proper contrast, possibly using a dark background and lighter text to improve readability while adhering to theming tokens.
**Updating CSS for select element**

We can improve the select element style by utilizing the CSS variables we created for colors. I propose defining a class like `.cell-header select` to set the background, text, and border colors. It's essential to ensure this works in both light and dark modes. I need to update the styles.css file for these changes and preserve the indentation style, using spaces. I'll also modify the select component's className to "cell-select" and check on the existence of the styles.css file, as it may have been deleted.
**Checking file existence and updating styles**

First, I should confirm the existence of the necessary files using read_file, then edit them accordingly. It’s good to include status updates per spec when making tool calls. However, since this is a small task, I’ll skip any todo lists. I need to modify Cell.tsx and styles.css to improve the select element's contrast.

I'll change the className in Cell.tsx to "cell-select" while keeping text-xs and ml-2 for easier styling. Then, I'll update styles.css to include styles for .cell-select and its states.
**Applying patches and checking styles**

I need to address the white-on-white button contrast issue, but the user has specifically requested the select element to be fixed first. I’ll apply the necessary patch and run checks for linting afterward. Regarding the TipTap Editor, it seems the label might actually refer to the select listing view names, which also has poor contrast due to white text. 

I’ll stick to the existing code style with two spaces for indentation, as that’s what the file uses. Let’s get those patches applied now.</details></think>

---

I'll update the `Cell` view selector to use a dedicated `cell-select` class and add CSS rules to ensure high-contrast background/text and proper focus/hover states, so it remains readable in light/dark themes. Then I’ll lint the changed files.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Addressing contrast issue**

I need to respond to the user about the reported contrast issue with the TipTap Editor's select. We've already made changes by adding the `cell-select` class and updating the CSS. It seems there's a discrepancy with deleted_files showing a path for styles.css, but we still have that file. The metadata might be outdated from their IDE. I need to ensure the TipTap Editor's toolbar buttons are high-contrast, and we'll focus on the select dropdown displaying the label. Additionally, I should verify that the `option` elements inherit the correct colors across different browsers.
**Considering selection and status update**

I'm looking into the WebKit selection styles to avoid a white-on-white issue, which is great. Since the user wrote in Portuguese, I should provide a concise status update in their language. I need to start the final message with a status update about fixing the select style using the class and CSS. I should tell them to refresh and confirm that the text color issue has been resolved. Also, I'll note the linter warning 'React declared but never read' in Cell.tsx, which we didn't introduce, but I'm considering whether to remove the React import or not.
**Fixing imports and CSS issues**

I noticed the instruction says to run read_lints after any edits and fix issues if they're clear. Since it’s simple, I’ll remove the React import from `Cell.tsx` to silence the warning. So, I’ll edit that first line.

I also need to check `Notebook.tsx`, but it doesn’t reference nav select classes. Meanwhile, I realized we changed the CSS root alias variables to use `oklch(var(--...)`, which might be wrong. The existing setup with `--card` already uses oklch values, making my reference invalid. I see now that `var(--card)` is the direct color, so I won't wrap it with oklch.
**Fixing color variables and styles**

I realized that in our patch, we incorrectly set `--bg-primary` with `oklch(var(--card))`; it should just be `var(--card)`. This could lead to contrast issues, so it's important we fix that. I'll update the styles.css with the correct variable references for various background and text colors, removing the oklch wrapping.

I also need to ensure the `.cell-select` sets `appearance: none;`, though it might not be necessary. The user only raised concerns about the select, so I’ll focus on that and keep things minimal while applying the patch.
**Finalizing updates and communication**

I need to prepare a brief reply in Portuguese, saying: "Corrigi o select com classe `cell-select` e styles que forçam bg/foreground, foco e option. Atualize e veja se ficou bom." 

I should also include a summary in a minimal bullet list. According to the instructions, I need to start with a status update noting that we updated `Cell.tsx`, added the class, fixed the token alias bug, removed the unused React import, and completed a lint clean. Finally, I'll apply patches to both `Cell.tsx` and `styles.css` and run lint checks again.</details></think>

---

I updated the select styling by adding a `cell-select` class in `Cell.tsx` and corresponding high-contrast styles in `styles.css`. I also corrected variable mappings in `styles.css` to avoid nested color functions and removed an unused React import to clear a linter warning. Now I’ll fix the variable mappings and remove the unused import, then check lints again.

- Apliquei contraste alto no select do cabeçalho da célula que mostra “TipTap Editor”.
- Mudanças:
  - `Cell.tsx`: substituí as classes inline do `<select>` por `cell-select`.
  - `styles.css`: adicionei estilos para `.cell-select` com background, texto e foco de alto contraste; corrigi os aliases de variáveis para evitar cores “lavadas”.

Se ainda aparecer difícil de ler em algum tema, me diga qual estado (normal, hover, focus, opções abertas) e eu ajusto imediatamente.
