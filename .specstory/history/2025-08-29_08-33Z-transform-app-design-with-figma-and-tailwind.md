# Transform app design with Figma and Tailwind (2025-08-29 08:33Z)

_**User**_

Use figma mcp, create a very detailed plan-figma.md and transform the app we have today to the design you're seeing in figma. Create components, add tailwidn tokens, create the sidebar, layout, everything. It must use the least amount of code possible but with all functionalities the UI shows

The dev before just made what we have now so it's all working, but we'll continue using the exact same functionalities!!!!!!!

Make sure we have all components, button and its variables (primary, secondary, etc), etc etc
Make a very big to-do list and pop off with this. Make sure it's the exact same. 

Make sure this WORKS above all things. The layout is very very important
