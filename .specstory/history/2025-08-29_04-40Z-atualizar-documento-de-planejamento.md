<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reviewing planning document**

I have a request in Portuguese asking me to complete the planning document `plans/gencode.md` with all necessary details to make updates in the current repository. First, I need to examine the content of this document and then determine what additional information is needed. It seems I should reference the tools to read the file. Even though this is a one-file edit, creating a to-do list might still be helpful to outline the necessary content updates. I’ll need to survey the code for any planned changes.
**Clarifying planning document updates**

The user hasn't specified which changes they need, but it could involve adding instructions for generating code or guiding implementation using the deco MCP template repository. There are workspace rules regarding necessary modifications, like updating the README and SEO when the app's intent is clear. I suspect the planning document has an outline for generating code with AI, so I'll read `plans/gencode.md`. We must include a status update before using any tools, like `functions.read_file`, to check this file first. I'll run the read now.</details></think>

---

I'll open the current `plans/gencode.md` to see what's there and determine what needs to be added.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning code updates**

I need to ensure we follow code style for the code we're writing, even if we're modifying a markdown planning file. I'll keep indentation consistent and minimize unnecessary chatter. It's essential to use tool calling sequences with status updates.

To start, I should probably read other files to get a sense of the current architecture. I'll open the server tools and pertinent hooks files and use parallel reads to examine several key files. A status update will be included before any tool calls, so let's get that organized!</details></think>

---

I'll scan key server and frontend files in parallel to tailor the plan precisely to this repo’s current notebook/cell implementation before updating `plans/gencode.md`.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating planning document**

I need to complete the planning document by adding everything necessary for implementing features from gencode.md into the current repository. First, I've studied the code, so I know the areas that need updating. Now, I’ll edit plans/gencode.md to include detailed steps like how to capture the JS cell return value to the cell output using env.getCellOutput(cellId), along with other technical aspects like omitting output, configuring output thresholds, and ensuring the entire notebook is sent to AI when running cells.
**Preparing planning document**

I realize the user wants a planning document, not actual code changes right now. It's within our workflow to update files, so I’ll edit plans/gencode.md, adding step-by-step content in Portuguese and referencing current code locations, like Notebook.tsx, notebook.ts, and toolCaller.ts. I plan to include acceptance criteria, proposed data model changes, and adjustments to the server tool's RUN_CELL input schema. I should also check the types file to confirm if cells have an 'outputs' field and then ensure the notebook types are updated accordingly.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering notebook execution features**

I’ve realized we aren’t saving the output of cells in a way that’s accessible later. There’s no `env.getCellOutput` implemented in the execution environment, which could be included in the frontend to handle outputs using closures or a mapping structure. Also, we’re generating cell IDs based on timestamps instead of using shorter, random IDs. Notebooks and cells are only stored in localStorage on the frontend, not on the server, which needs attention in our proposal. Lastly, the RUN_CELL tool should ideally include the entire notebook content, as per the user’s instructions.
**Enhancing cell output handling**

I need to ensure we mention `omitOutputToAi` to prevent large outputs when modifying the RUN_CELL tool. While it currently gets the entire notebook, it only utilizes the cell's content for the prompt. We should include more context and implement `omitOutputToAi` based on cell type. Additionally, I’ll add a configuration for `outputMaxSize` in the notebook. We’re also capturing the return value in the outputs field, but we need to ensure we can access it later by cell ID using a mapping system. Lastly, I'll plan to improve the execution environment to read and manage outputs effectively.
**Refining cell output processes**

I’m going to go with "env.getCellOutput(cellId)" for retrieving cell outputs. We also need to ensure that each JavaScript code returns a value, as instructed by the user. Currently, the executor captures the function result and stores it, which is fine—but per the spec, this function should pull outputs from previously executed cells. I'll need to detail step-by-step changes in a planning document, updating the `plans/gencode.md`. Even though it’s a simple doc update, it involves multiple steps, which might require a lengthier plan as they want everything necessary documented.
**Updating documentation and configurations**

Although code changes haven't been requested yet, I’ll update the documentation to include explicit tasks and a detailed code-level plan, complete with file paths and diffs. I need to make sure we revise the prompts for the AI to handle the entire notebook, as the "all notebook to AI when RUN cell" suggests adjustments to the tool's prompt and schema. Additionally, I’ll propose adding an `omitOutputToAi` boolean and an `outputMaxSize` config. These changes will need to be reflected in the types for the notebook, and we might also standardize how we store output structures.</details></think>

I'm going to update the planning document with a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan tailored to this repository, covering types, frontend execution environment, IDs, AI prompt changes, and testing.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Summarizing tool instructions**

I’m realizing that even though the tool suggests running read_lints with specific files after changes, this is just a suggestion. Since the document is a .md, the linter might not actually run. The "linter_errors" guideline indicates that read_lints is meant for code files, so we could skip it. I need to make sure the final message includes a brief status update and a concise summary of the changes, while keeping verbosity to a minimum.
**Analyzing code edits**

I’m looking at changes related to cell types, env.getCellOutput, and prompt adjustments. It seems like we're addressing capturing return values and ensuring the omitOutputToAi boolean functions correctly for the cell. We're also sending the entire notebook to AI with certain outputs truncated and omitting some details. I need to maintain indentation since it's in a .md file, and it's good that we're using spaces. I should check on the existence of utility files and confirm our modifications are aligned correctly.
**Clarifying code alignment**

I see that in Notebook.tsx, executeJavaScript returns a result where the outputs content is set as result.success ? result.output : result.error. However, it uses 'any' instead of a 'string', but types say it should be a string. This could indicate a misalignment, so I should note that we need to store a JSON-serialized string. The plan suggests standardizing content as a JSON string, which I should include. Finally, I'll provide a brief status update about the files I've reviewed and the updated plan document.</details></think>

I reviewed the current notebook implementation (server and frontend) and added a concrete, repo-specific plan to `plans/gencode.md` covering IDs, output capture, `env.getCellOutput`, prompt updates, and size-based AI output omission. Now I’ll proceed once you confirm or want me to start implementing.

- Changes made: Extended the planning doc with detailed steps, file-by-file edits, prompt adjustments, and acceptance criteria.

- Next (on request): Implement the edits across `view/src/types/notebook.ts`, `view/src/components/Notebook/Notebook.tsx`, `server/tools/notebook.ts`, and small UI tweaks.

- Risks: Ensure outputs are serialized consistently to match `Cell.outputs.content: string` and avoid leaking oversized outputs to AI.

- You can review the updated plan here:
```1:300:/Users/lucis/deco/studio/plans/gencode.md
Há uma parte importante desse sistema para fecharmos: as chamadas de javascript devem sempre voltar um valor de resposta, que devemos capturar para adicionar no cell (e utilizar desse valor)

Hoje em dia, acho que não estamos capturando isso. Preciso que você complemente esse documento apos estudar o ssitema, o estado atual, e como fazemos essa implementacao 

Isso é útil, por exemplo, para trabalhos continuos onde um dado depende do outro 

Para isso funcionar, vamos precisar que, quando um step é um código javascript, o valor retornado quando ele é executado seja capturado e salvo dentro da cell no output

No env, deve haver um env.getCellOutput("cellId"). Each cell should have an auto generated id, 6 chars.

Precisamos, então, também fazer essa engine funcionar 

Quero também adicionar um parametro no cell de omitOutputToAi?: boolean. We should set this to true if output is very large (>6000 chars, configurable in the notebook outputMaxsize). Fácil de configurar.

Quero também garantir que estamos enviando todo o notebook para a AI quando pedimos pra RUN cell. Isso é necessário para a AI saber fazer codigo que se utiliza ou da informacao de outro step ou código que vai referenciar a informacao de outro step como variavel ou vai fazer uma tool call parecida com o que o outro step fez, a depender do pedido (inclua no nosso doc um ajuste prompt para contemplar isso)

Plano de implementação (repo atual)

1) Tipos e configurações
- Adicionar no tipo `Cell` a flag opcional `omitOutputToAi?: boolean`.
- Adicionar no tipo `Notebook` uma configuração opcional `settings?: { outputMaxSize?: number }` com default 6000.
- Padronizar que o retorno de células JavaScript vira um output com `type: "json"` e `content` como JSON serializado do valor retornado.

Arquivos a editar:
- `view/src/types/notebook.ts`
  - Extender `Cell` e `Notebook` conforme acima.

2) IDs curtos (6 chars) para células
- Criar um util `genId(len = 6)` que gera IDs alfanuméricos.
- Substituir todos os lugares que criam `cell.id` para usar `genId(6)`.
- Locais:
  - `view/src/hooks/useNotebooks.ts` (células default e novas)
  - `view/src/components/Notebook/Notebook.tsx` (células geradas via AI em RUN_CELL e no menu "Add Cell")

Snippet util (exemplo):
```ts
// view/src/lib/utils.ts (ou arquivo existente utils)
export const genId = (len = 6) => Array.from(crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(len)))
  .map((b) => (b % 36).toString(36))
  .join("");
```

3) Engine de execução JS no frontend
- Hoje capturamos o valor retornado em `executeJavaScript` e escrevemos em `outputs`. Manter isso, mas:
  - Expor `env.getCellOutput(cellId: string)` no ambiente de execução para que JS de outras células leiam o último output JSON dessa célula.
  - Marcar `omitOutputToAi` automaticamente quando o tamanho do output exceder `notebook.settings?.outputMaxSize ?? 6000`.
- Estrutura do `getCellOutput`:
  - Procura a célula pelo `id` no `notebook` atual
  - Retorna `undefined` se não existir
  - Retorna o `content` do último item de `outputs` cujo `type` ∈ {"json","text","html"} (priorizar `json` se existir)

Arquivos a editar:
- `view/src/components/Notebook/Notebook.tsx`
  - Alterar `createExecutionEnvironment()` para receber `notebook` (e, se preferir, um `getNotebook()` para estado fresco) e incluir `getCellOutput` no objeto `env` raiz.
  - Após `const result = await func(wrappedEnv);`:
    - Persistir em `outputs` o valor retornado (já existe)
    - Calcular `const max = notebook.settings?.outputMaxSize ?? 6000;` e, se `JSON.stringify(result).length > max`, atualizar a célula com `omitOutputToAi: true`.

Exemplo de adição ao `env`:
```ts
const createExecutionEnvironment = (notebook: NotebookType) => ({
  getCellOutput: (cellId: string) => {
    const cell = notebook.cells.find((c) => c.id === cellId);
    if (!cell?.outputs?.length) return undefined;
    const json = [...cell.outputs].reverse().find((o) => o.type === "json");
    if (json) return json.content;
    const textOrHtml = [...cell.outputs].reverse().find((o) => o.type === "text" || o.type === "html");
    return textOrHtml?.content;
  },
  // ... integrações já existentes (DATABASES, TEAMS, etc.)
});
```

4) Ajustes no RUN_CELL (server) para enviar TODO o notebook
- Já enviamos `notebook.cells` no input do tool, mas o prompt considera hoje apenas o conteúdo do `cellToRun`. Ajustar o prompt para:
  - Incluir um resumo do notebook inteiro (tipo, conteúdo e, quando `omitOutputToAi !== true`, outputs truncados a `outputMaxSize`).
  - Instruir a IA a:
    1) Sempre gerar JS que retorne um valor (o último statement deve "return" o principal resultado)
    2) Usar `env.getCellOutput("<id>")` quando precisar reutilizar dados de outras células
    3) Evitar repetir markdown; quando a célula atual for markdown, gerar apenas código JS

Arquivos a editar:
- `server/tools/notebook.ts`
  - Atualizar a construção do `prompt` para algo como:

```ts
const max = 6000; // não precisa ser exato; aqui é só prompt-side
const notebookContext = context.notebook.cells.map((c, i) => ({
  idx: i,
  id: c.id ?? `idx_${i}`,
  type: c.type,
  content: c.content?.slice(0, 2000),
  outputs: c.omitOutputToAi ? undefined : (c.outputs?.map(o => ({
    type: o.type,
    content: ("" + o.content).slice(0, max)
  })) || undefined)
}));

const prompt = `Você é um gerador de células JavaScript para um Notebook.

CONTEXT0: NOTEBOOK COMPLETO (com outputs truncados quando necessário)
${JSON.stringify(notebookContext)}

CONTEXT1: CÉLULA ACIONADA
Index: ${context.cellToRun}
ID: ${context.notebook.cells[context.cellToRun]?.id}
Tipo: ${context.notebook.cells[context.cellToRun]?.type}
Conteúdo: ${context.notebook.cells[context.cellToRun]?.content}

REGRAS:
1. Se a célula acionada for markdown, gere APENAS uma nova célula JavaScript que execute a solicitação.
2. Sempre retorne um valor no final do código (isso será capturado como output da célula).
3. Para reutilizar dados de outras células, use env.getCellOutput("<id-da-celula>").
4. Para tools, use a sintaxe env.APP.TOOL(params) (exemplos abaixo).
5. Não repita conteúdo markdown em texto; implemente diretamente o que foi pedido.
`;
```
  - Manter `schema` atual (cellsToAdd), mas atualizar a descrição para reforçar o retorno de valor e o uso de `env.getCellOutput`.

5) Enriquecer o ambiente de execução com contagem de chamadas
- Já contamos `apiCalls`. Manter e, opcionalmente, expor `env.__stats = { apiCalls }` para debug.

6) UX/Observabilidade
- Exibir o `id` da célula na UI (pequeno badge ao lado do tipo) para facilitar referência no código.
- Quando `omitOutputToAi` estiver verdadeiro, indicar visualmente (ex.: badge "Output omitido para IA").

Arquivos a editar:
- `view/src/components/Cell/Cell.tsx` (exibir ID e badge)

7) Critérios de aceite
- Rodar uma célula JS com `return 1+1` deve salvar em `outputs[0] = { type: "json", content: 2 }` e permitir `env.getCellOutput(<id>)` retornar `2` a partir de outra célula.
- Quando o tamanho do `JSON.stringify(output)` exceder `outputMaxSize`, a célula deve ser atualizada com `omitOutputToAi: true`.
- Ao executar RUN em uma célula markdown que peça dados transformados a partir de outra célula, a IA deve gerar JS que use `env.getCellOutput("<id>")` no código.

8) Testes
- Manual:
  - Criar duas células: (1) JS que retorna um array grande; (2) JS que lê esse retorno via `env.getCellOutput("<id-da-1>")` e processa.
  - Verificar marcação automática de `omitOutputToAi` quando exceder 6000 chars.
  - Rodar markdown que peça "Filtrar os 10 primeiros elementos do output da célula <id>" e validar que o código gerado usa `env.getCellOutput`.
- Automatizável (futuro):
  - Extrair funções de env/exec para módulos testáveis e escrever unit tests para `getCellOutput`.

9) Observações importantes
- Segurança: continuamos executando JS do usuário no browser (`new Function`). Não injetar objetos de janela/documento no env. Mantemos apenas proxies de tools e utilidades controladas.
- Performance: truncar outputs no prompt (server) e evitar enviar outputs marcados com `omitOutputToAi`.

10) Lista de edits por arquivo (resumo)
- `view/src/types/notebook.ts`: adicionar `omitOutputToAi?: boolean` em `Cell`; `settings?: { outputMaxSize?: number }` em `Notebook`.
- `view/src/lib/utils.ts`: adicionar `genId` (ou reaproveitar util existente).
- `view/src/hooks/useNotebooks.ts`: usar `genId(6)` para IDs default/novas.
- `view/src/components/Notebook/Notebook.tsx`:
  - Passar `notebook` para `createExecutionEnvironment`.
  - Incluir `getCellOutput` no `env`.
  - Após execução JS, atualizar `outputs` e `omitOutputToAi` quando necessário com base em `outputMaxSize`.
  - Usar `genId(6)` para novas células (inclusive geradas pela IA).
- `view/src/components/Cell/Cell.tsx`: exibir ID e badge de omissão quando aplicável.
- `server/tools/notebook.ts`: ajustar `prompt` para incluir notebook completo (com outputs truncados) e instruções de `return` + `env.getCellOutput`.

11) Prompt (versão final a usar no server)
```text
Você é um gerador de código para células JavaScript dentro de um Notebook.

CONTEXT0: NOTEBOOK COMPLETO (cells com type, content e outputs, estes truncados e omitidos quando indicado)
<JSON do notebook, com outputs truncados e omitidos quando omitOutputToAi=true>

CONTEXT1: CÉLULA ACIONADA
- index e id da célula
- type e content

REGRAS:
1) Se a célula acionada for markdown, gere APENAS uma nova célula { type: "javascript", content: "..." }.
2) O código gerado DEVE terminar com um `return <valor>` representando o resultado principal.
3) Para reutilizar dados de outras células, chame `env.getCellOutput("<id>")`.
4) Para usar ferramentas, chame `env.APP.TOOL(params)` conforme exemplos fornecidos.
5) Não repita markdown em texto; implemente diretamente o pedido em JS.
```

12) Defaults sugeridos
- `Notebook.settings.outputMaxSize = 6000` quando ausente.
- Ao criar notebooks/células, popular `id` com `genId(6)`.

Com isso cobrimos: captura do retorno das células JS, acesso a outputs via `env.getCellOutput`, IDs de 6 chars, sinalização de outputs grandes com `omitOutputToAi`, e envio do notebook completo (com outputs truncados/omitidos) para a IA no RUN da célula.
```

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing the coding plan**

I need to implement several changes in the code, such as adding types, using the genId utility, and modifying both the useNotebooks and Notebook components to utilize genId. I also want to add getCellOutput in the execution environment and set a flag to omit output to AI when the size exceeds a threshold. The server tool prompt needs to include the full notebook and instructions. I must ensure all lints are followed, update statuses before edits, and manage parallel edits carefully.
**Updating code and lints**

I need to ensure that after making code changes, I run the read_lints tool for the files affected. Although there's no build/test process, I can still verify the code through lints. The existing codebase probably doesn't have a linter integrated, but the read_lints tool can be called with specific file paths. 

For updates, I’ll add omitOutputToAi and settings to the corresponding types in notebook.ts. I also need to maintain proper indentation, which appears to be two spaces based on the existing style, and I'll keep the content type as a string, even for JSON content.
**Addressing type mismatches in Notebook**

The plan mentions that content should be JSON serialized, but currently, the function in Notebook.tsx executes JavaScript, returning a result with outputs of type 'json', where the content can be an object. However, in `types/notebook.ts`, the outputs.content is strictly defined as a string. 

To fix this type mismatch, I need to use JSON.stringify when setting outputs. I’ll also add the genId utility to `view/src/lib/utils.ts` without breaking existing functions. Lastly, I should update useNotebooks.ts to change cell IDs to use genId for uniqueness.
**Updating default settings and Notebook.tsx**

I’ll add a default setting for the notebook with outputMaxSize set to 6000, which is fine since we can store new fields in localStorage. 

Next, in Notebook.tsx, I need to import the updated NotebookType and genId. For cell creation in the addCell function, the cell.id currently uses a timestamp template, so I'll switch this to genId(6). Additionally, when mapping result.cellsToAdd for AI-generated cells, the id will also be changed to use genId(6). 

Lastly, I will update the createExecutionEnvironment function to include the notebook parameter and include getCellOutput as described.
**Implementing createExecutionEnvironment**

I’ll implement the function createExecutionEnvironment with the parameter notebook of type NotebookType. I’ll capture the result from await func(wrappedEnv). The result already returns success as true and includes an output. To align the content with JSON typing, I’ll adjust it to use JSON.stringify for success and convert errors to strings. 

After execution, I’ll compute the size of the JSON output to decide if we need to set omitOutputToAi to true. I'll also ensure that the outputs array isn’t too large since we’re working with stringified content.

Next, I'll update the run markdown path to handle generated cells and ensure that the envProxy counters remain unaffected. Lastly, I see that I may need to check the UI in Cell/Cell.tsx to confirm the structure, especially for showing IDs and omitting badges.</details></think>

Read file: undefined

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing Notebook IDs**

I need to use `genId` in both `useNotebooks.ts` and `Notebook.tsx` to generate new cell IDs. In `useNotebooks.ts`, the default notebook ID is 'cell_welcome', and new notebook cells are 'cell_new'; these should instead use `genId(6)`. We should import `genId` for this. Also, while notebook IDs can remain consistent, only cell IDs need to be six characters. 

In `Notebook.tsx`, I will modify `createExecutionEnvironment` to pass the notebook context as a parameter, enhancing the JS execution environment.
**Updating Execution Environment and Outputs**

I’m planning to modify `createExecutionEnvironment` to use a closure around `notebook` in the Notebook component. Currently, it doesn't take any arguments and uses the client inside; using closure seems fine, but I must ensure to include the `getCellOutput` property.

Next, I need to update `executeJavaScript` to return `success: true` and `output: result` after computation. The `runCell` function should update outputs accordingly. Right now, it assigns the output without ensuring that it’s serialized to a string. I need to make sure that the `content` type remains consistent with the string expectation.
**Adjusting Output Serialization and Flags**

It looks like our plan needs us to serialize outputs to a JSON string. So, if the execution is successful, should I call `JSON.stringify`? But then, displaying that might show just the JSON string. The output viewer checks if `output.content` is a string; otherwise, it stringifies again. 

I also want to implement an `omitOutputToAi` flag when the JSON size exceeds the maximum limit. I’ll modify the JS execution step to compute the serialized string and check its length. I'll store this flag in the output content string. 

Additionally, I’ll add `getCellOutput` to the environment, returning the content, and if that’s stringified JSON, I might need to parse it to adhere to the plan. Also, I still need to keep track of the API calls count—let's note that at 5.
**Updating UI and Server Requests**

For the UI, I want to show the actual cell ID instead of just "CELL_{index}" in `Cell.tsx`. I'll also add an omission badge if `cell.omitOutputToAi` is true; I can do this by inserting a small span.

Next, I must update the server's `RUN_CELL` prompt to include the full notebook context, specifically the outputs and instruct it to use `getCellOutput`. Currently, the `createRunCellTool` input schema only includes cells with type and content. To properly include outputs and IDs, I'll adjust the frontend call in `Notebook.tsx` to expand the `client.RUN_CELL` request to also include `id`, `outputs`, and `omitOutputToAi`, ensuring we stick to our limited info plan.
**Updating Server Schema and Client Invocation**

Since the tool's `inputSchema` is currently stricter, I need to modify the server tool's schema to accept `id`, `outputs`, and an optional `omitOutputToAi`. I plan to update the schema to `z.object` with these properties. After that, I’ll adjust the prompt generation and the prompt string to line up with our plans.

For the client invocation in `Notebook.runCell`, I’ll make sure to include `id`, `type`, `content`, `outputs`, and the omit flag. Additionally, I need to ensure that notebook types include settings by adding defaults in `useNotebooks` for both the default and new notebooks.

Next, I’ll implement `genId` in `Notebook.tsx` for new cells created by AI and from the AddCell menu, using `Date.now` for the ID generation. I'll replace the ID assignment with `genId` and ensure the appropriate imports are included. 

Import paths need to be correct: for `Notebook.tsx`, import from `'../../lib/utils'`; for `useNotebooks.ts`, it’s from `'../lib/utils'`. I may not need to import anything in `Cell.tsx`.

I also want to add `omitOutputToAi` and settings to the types. While adjusting the server tool file, I need to keep the size under 300 lines; it's currently around 155.

Finally, I’ll perform edits across multiple files in sequence using `apply_patch` for each file, keeping in mind the need for status updates before too, following the developer specs. After edits, running `read_lints` on the edited files is essential. Let's get started!</details></think>

---

I'll start by editing the types, then update the server tool prompt and input schema, add the genId utility, and wire it into the frontend code. After that, I'll augment the JS execution environment and UI.

## Todo List

- [x] Extend Cell and Notebook types with omitOutputToAi and settings
- [-] Add genId(6) util and switch cell ID generation across app
- [ ] Augment JS execution env with getCellOutput and output-size flagging
- [ ] Show cell id and omission badge in UI
- [ ] Update server RUN_CELL prompt to include full notebook context

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing ID generation changes**

I need to implement additions across multiple files. First, I'll add the `genId` utility to the `utils` file. Currently, it only has a `cn`, so I’ll add the export for `genId` while keeping the style consistent.

Next, I should switch ID generation for notebooks. In `useNotebooks.ts`, I'll update the `createDefaultNotebook` to use `genId(6)` instead of a static ID. I also need to apply this change in `Notebook.tsx` for `addCell` and new cells generated from AI, replacing `Date.now()` based IDs with `genId(6)`. Finally, I need to modify `createExecutionEnvironment` to accept the notebook for access to `getCellOutput`.
**Modifying the Notebook function**

I'm focusing on modifying the function declared within the Notebook component to accept a `notebook` parameter, or I could capture it via closure. The easiest way is to modify `createExecutionEnvironment` to take a `notebookCurrent: NotebookType` parameter. I realize I already import `NotebookType` from '../../types/notebook' at the top of `Notebook.tsx`, which is good. 

I also need to ensure that when calling `executeJavaScript`, I pass the newly created environment with the notebook as `createExecutionEnvironment(notebook)`. Additionally, I’ll add `getCellOutput` inside the environment root rather than a namespace. We'll keep track of calls and wrappers for `env.*`, and I'll need to implement a flag for `omitOutputToAi` if the output size is large, possibly calculating the size after executing JavaScript and before updating cell outputs.
**Aligning content types**

I need to address a mismatch with the `content` type, which expects a string but is being set to either `result.output` or `result.error`. The code currently handles this by using JSON.stringify if `typeof content` is not a string. However, since we can set `content` to `result.output`—which could be an object—it might not compile properly because TypeScript defines `content` as a string.

It seems like the TypeScript settings allowed for 'any' previously. I want to keep things consistent with our plan: treating `content` as `result.output`, even if it’s not a string, but ensuring to set it as `JSON.stringify(result.output)` when updating the outputs in the success path. I'll also need to consider the `omitOutputToAi` threshold by comparing length accordingly.
**Standardizing rendering logic**

Currently, the rendering logic stringifies non-strings, which seems fine, but I want us to standardize this. To avoid large refactoring, I’ll compute the length using `JSON.stringify(result.output)` and set `omitOutputToAi` to true if the length exceeds the maximum. 

To update cells, I need to ensure we add the necessary field and merge updates with `updateCell`. I also want to include `getCellOutput` to return the last output content, and since the content could be a string or an object, I’ll parse it accordingly. If `output.type` is 'json', I’ll try `JSON.parse` for strings, but if it's an object, I’ll just return it as is. This should simplify the logic.
**Updating cell handling and functions**

The plan requires us to standardize how we handle outputs. I’ll create a generic function that captures outputs from cells, iterating in reverse to prioritize JSON over text or HTML types. If the content is JSON, I'll attempt to parse it using `JSON.parse`; otherwise, I'll return it as is.

Next, I need to modify the server tool `RUN_CELL`. The input schema must now accept notebook cells with options for `id`, `type`, `content`, `outputs`, and `omitOutputToAi`. Currently, the client call in `Notebook.tsx` sends trimmed details, so I’ll adjust this to include more context like ID and outputs. I’ll change the mapping in `runCell`, ensuring we build with the necessary flags and data. 

Additionally, I’m implementing UI changes to display cell IDs and flags, updating `Notebook.tsx` with new usage of `genId` for ID generation, and ensuring consistency across all related functions and calls. I'll adjust the execution environment to include the required methods, like `getCellOutput`. Finally, I’ll ensure the server-side handles length truncation as specified, and update prompts accordingly for proper context. I'll manage all edits across the specified files.
**Implementing UI badges and style preservation**

I need to ensure that I preserve the existing indentation and style in the repository, which uses 2-space indentation. The types file follows this style, so I'll maintain that consistency.

Next, I'll add UI badges in `view/src/components/Cell/Cell.tsx`. I plan to display the ID and, if `cell.omitOutputToAi` is true, include a span indicating that. This means I'll modify the header to show the actual unique ID alongside 'CELL_{index padded}', appending 'ID:<cell.id>'.

I’m wondering if we need to adjust any linting settings. Once I've made these changes, I’ll run the linter to ensure everything's tidy. Let's get started on these patches!</details></think>

I updated the TODOs and I'm about to implement code changes across multiple files concurrently: add genId, switch cell ID generation, augment JS env, update server prompt, and UI badges. I'll run edits now.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing a fix**

I'm looking at how the server or tool uses JSON.stringify(notebookContext) in a template, and I think that's fine as it is. I just need to move forward and implement the necessary fix. It seems straightforward, but I want to ensure that I'm addressing any potential issues thoroughly. Let's take one step at a time and make sure everything is working correctly!</details></think>

## Todo List

- [x] Extend Cell and Notebook types with omitOutputToAi and settings
- [x] Add genId(6) util and switch cell ID generation across app
- [x] Augment JS execution env with getCellOutput and output-size flagging
- [x] Show cell id and omission badge in UI
- [x] Update server RUN_CELL prompt to include full notebook context

---

All set. I implemented the plan.

- Types: Added `omitOutputToAi?: boolean` to `Cell` and `settings?: { outputMaxSize?: number }` to `Notebook` in `view/src/types/notebook.ts`.
- IDs: Added `genId()` in `view/src/lib/utils.ts` and switched cell ID generation in `useNotebooks` and `Notebook` to 6-char IDs.
- JS env: Added `env.getCellOutput(cellId)` and automatic output-size flagging to `view/src/components/Notebook/Notebook.tsx`. JavaScript cell return values are captured and used to set `outputs` and `omitOutputToAi` when exceeding `outputMaxSize` (default 6000).
- Server prompt: Updated `server/tools/notebook.ts` to accept richer notebook input, include the full notebook context with truncated outputs, and instruct the AI to always return a value and to use `env.getCellOutput("<id>")`. Also normalized `cellsToAdd` parsing to the expected typed shape.
- UI: In `view/src/components/Cell/Cell.tsx`, the header shows the cell `id` and an “AI OUTPUT OMITTED” badge when `omitOutputToAi` is true.

You can run and test:
- Run a JS cell with `return 1+1` to see the JSON output.
- Create a large output to see `omitOutputToAi` auto-flag.
- Run a markdown cell requesting data reuse; AI will receive full notebook context and should generate JS using `env.getCellOutput("<id>")`.

- Summary of key edits:
  - `view/src/types/notebook.ts`: new fields.
  - `view/src/lib/utils.ts`: new `genId`.
  - `view/src/hooks/useNotebooks.ts`: IDs and default settings.
  - `view/src/components/Notebook/Notebook.tsx`: env/getCellOutput, size-based omit, genId usage, full notebook sent on RUN.
  - `view/src/components/Cell/Cell.tsx`: cell id label + omit badge.
  - `server/tools/notebook.ts`: input schema, prompt, and safe result parsing.

If you want, I can also add a small helper button to copy a cell’s `id` to clipboard, or add a tooltip showing how to reference it with `env.getCellOutput("<id>")`.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Investigating the run button issue**

I’m noticing that the run button appears to be hidden for markdown. In the past, there’s been mention of a legacy render mode switcher with an onExecute function. Also, I see that in Notebook.tsx’s CellComponent, they pass the onRun to ViewWrapper. I’ll check out TipTapView.tsx to see if it has a run button feature, as that might help clarify things. Let’s dig into it!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Assessing AI calls in markdown**

I need to assess the issue with the user's ability to call AI from a markdown block. Previously, running a markdown cell would trigger a request to generate content, but it seems our modifications might have changed this. The config for markdown now has `canExecute=false`, which likely prevents the run button from appearing. If that's the case, the user can't trigger the AI call. I should check how the run button is managed in `Cell.tsx` for further clarity.
**Investigating markdown execution**

I'm digging into the Notebook.tsx to figure out the issues surrounding the markdown execution. Previously, the run button was controlled by `canExecute`, which seems to be false now, preventing any markdown from running. I'm wondering how they could run markdown before if `canExecute` was also false. Maybe there was a run button present irrespective of that condition. I need to check the earlier code versions in availableViews and see if we altered any gating that impacted this functionality.
**Clarifying markdown run functionality**

I've realized that our recent edits to Cell.tsx only added ID display and badges; they didn't alter the run gating. The logic for invoking `client.RUN_CELL` in Notebook.tsx remains unchanged. The issue seems to be that the run button is hidden for markdown while users can still run using Cmd+Enter. This could be due to the TipTapView not passing the keydown event properly. The keyboard run handler is set for legacy fallbacks, but TipTapView isn't listening for it.
**Fixing markdown run issues**

Since the run button isn't displayed when using TipTapView for markdown, it seems this setup prevents running functionality altogether. This could suggest that a different view was previously used to allow running markdown. To resolve this, I could either set the TipTapView's `canExecute` to true in the AVAILABLE_VIEWS or keep the run button visible in the header. Another option is to add a "RUN" button in the TipTap toolbar to trigger execution. The simplest solution might be adjusting the availability of `canExecute` for markdown.
**Implementing changes for markdown run**

To simplify the solution, just showing the RUN button in the header is enough. I’ll change the `canExecute` to true for TipTap in availableViews.ts. I also think adding a run button in the TipTap toolbar could enhance functionality. I’ll ensure the server tool expects the correct input schema with optional fields. 

With these updates, the run button should now display correctly. I’ll also check if Workflow view had `canExecute` set to true. After I make these edits, I’ll run lints and apply patches.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating rendering paths**

I’m thinking about the fallback "legacy rendering" path where the check for "selectedView.config?.canEdit" determines the render mode. It seems like there might have been a UI issue for cells that can’t be edited. In Cell.tsx, the run button is gated by "selectedView.config?.canExecute," so it won’t show if that’s false. This means if it’s false for markdown cells, the run button won't be visible, impacting the user’s ability to call AI. But we adjusted "availableViews.ts" to allow execution for TipTapView. Now enabling the run button should fix this!
**Updating input schema**

I’ve realized we changed the RUN_CELL input schema in Notebook.tsx to send an object with id, type, content, omitOutputToAi, and outputs. The server uses Zod for optional output content types. In Notebook.tsx, we're passing outputs content as a string or JSON after slicing it. It’s important to ensure that the content handling is correct. There are some other issues to address: TipTapView has canExecute set, but it’s missing onExecute integration. I need to verify that the RUN_CELL description on the server hasn't changed.
**Updating server connection**

I think the server tool ID still remains "RUN_CELL." The client calls client.RUN_CELL, and while the typed client requires a build, it runs fine. It’s important to state that we made TipTap's canExecute true for markdown. I also want to ensure I update the status properly and run lints, though we already did that. Following the status update spec, I’ll provide a brief note about the changes: the RUN button is now visible for markdown in TipTap, allowing it to call AI.
**Finalizing changes**

Great, I’ve confirmed there are no regressions and the lint is clean. I want to offer testing and include minimal clicks, keeping in line with verbosity guidelines. I’ll also mention a potential issue regarding changes to the client.RUN_CELL input shape in Notebook.tsx, but since we've updated the server accordingly, it should be fine. In summary, the main change was toggling canExecute for TipTap, and that's all for now. Let's wrap this up!</details></think>

---

- I found the issue: the RUN button is only shown if `selectedView.config.canExecute` is true. For markdown (`TipTapView`), this was set to false, so you couldn’t run a markdown cell to trigger AI.
- I fixed it by enabling execution for TipTap.

Key edit:
- `view/src/utils/availableViews.ts`: set TipTap’s `canExecute` to `true`.

You should now see the RUN button on markdown cells and be able to call the AI again.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing a fix for serialization**

I need to make sure I'm converting to a string before slicing, using either String(...) or defaulting to an empty string. The line I’ll use is: `const s = typeof o.content === 'string' ? o.content : JSON.stringify(o.content ?? '');` Then I’ll ensure it's a string by doing `(s ?? '').slice(0, max)`. It seems that if `o.content` is undefined, it should fallback to 'null' as a string instead. I’ll make these adjustments in the Notebook.tsx runCell mapping section. Additionally, I'll account for cases where output might be absent.
**Adjusting output handling**

I realize I need to handle the output string properly. Initially, I set `const outStr = result.success ? JSON.stringify(result.output) : String(result.error ?? '');`, but I found that if `result.success` is true and `JSON.stringify(result.output)` is undefined, it causes an error when I check outStr.length. So, I’ll need to coerce it to a string properly, ensuring that `outStr` is never undefined. It should look like `const outStr = result.success ? JSON.stringify(result.output) ?? '' : String(result.error);`. I’ll also consider that `result.output` can be an object and may not always be a string, so I need to address that in my type definitions as well.
**Fixing runtime string handling**

At runtime, I'm noticing that we might be dealing with non-string values. When we read from `env.getCellOutput`, we treat `content` as a flexible type and sometimes even parse it as JSON. To prevent length and slicing errors, I’m planning a few fixes. First, in the RUN_CELL payload, I'll ensure the content is a safe string, using `const serial = typeof o.content === 'string' ? o.content : JSON.stringify(o.content ?? null);` Secondly, I’ll adjust the output string definition to handle cases where it might not be a string: `const str = result.success ? JSON.stringify(result.output) ?? '' : String(result.error ?? '');`. I'll also ensure that cell.outputs are saved as string types. Now, I’ll implement this patch and check for any other instances where slicing might encounter undefined values.</details></think>

The error comes from slicing an undefined string when serializing outputs for the AI payload.

- Root cause: In `Notebook.tsx` when building `outputs` for the RUN_CELL call, we did:
  - `(typeof o.content === 'string' ? o.content : JSON.stringify(o.content)).slice(0, max)`
  - If `o.content` is undefined or `JSON.stringify` returns undefined, `.slice` throws.

- Fix applied in `view/src/components/Notebook/Notebook.tsx`:
  - Safely serialize each output:
    - `const serialized = typeof o.content === 'string' ? o.content : JSON.stringify(o.content ?? null);`
    - `const safe = (serialized ?? '').slice(0, max);`
    - Return `{ type: o.type, content: safe }`.

- Also guarded JS cell return serialization:
  - `const outStr = result.success ? (JSON.stringify(result.output) ?? '') : String(result.error ?? '');`

Please try running the notebook again. The markdown-to-AI flow should work without the `.slice` TypeError.

ok, eu testei um code mas... em alguma das nossas mudanças acho que perdemos a parte do output da função

gerei esse codigo

// Pede um número ao usuário
const numero = prompt("Digite um número:");

// Converte a entrada para número
const numeroConvertido = Number(numero);

// Multiplica o número por dois
const resultado = numeroConvertido * 2;

// Retorna o resultado
return resultado;

ele fez o alert, preenchi, mas nada a aconteceu

Precisamos:

- dedicar quando a funcao return
- mostrar para o usuário o retorno

Vamos mostrar logo a baixo, quase como se fosse um outro bloco

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing function return display**

I’m looking at the requirement, which mentions showing the function's return value to the user. To make this work, I need to update `Cell.tsx` so that it always renders the outputs beneath the main content. We can keep the render mode toggle, but add a compact preview for the latest return. 

I’ll check if the outputs exist and set up an area to display the results with a clear header like "RETURN" or "OUTPUT" for better readability.
**Updating output display**

The user mentioned something about an alert, but their code uses a prompt instead, which is a bit confusing. I'll need to modify `Cell.tsx`, specifically after line 266, to always display outputs instead of relying on the renderMode. 

The plan is to remove the specific condition and, ideally, show the last output as the main "return" result while still keeping the option to display all outputs. I’ll add a section right after the content area for the outputs whenever there are any, ensuring the CSS looks consistent.
**Implementing changes for output handling**

I’m updating the output handling. I’ll replace the condition that relies on `renderMode` with a simpler one that just checks if there are outputs to display. 

Additionally, I want to ensure we always set outputs as type 'json'. Right now, for cases where the prompt returns a number, we store it as `result.output`, even though our type definition expects a string. Fortunately, the rendering check in `Cell.tsx` should handle this correctly by converting non-string outputs to JSON. It looks like these type mismatches won’t lead to runtime issues, but it's something to keep an eye on.
**Applying output display patch**

I’m considering that TypeScript might flag some errors, but the linter tool didn't catch the type mismatch, which I’ll play it safe on. The user also mentioned wanting the outputs shown right below the content area, almost like a separate block. To enhance the user experience, we could add a small "toast" or anchored block for notifications, although it's not necessary. 

I’ll need to ensure the `prompt` can run in the JS environment correctly. Since it’s already executed with `new Function`, we’re good there. Now I just need to patch `Cell.tsx` to display outputs consistently, while adhering to the two-space indentation style used in the file.
**Implementing additional output features**

I'm thinking we could enhance the output section with a small "Return" header while keeping the existing CSS classes like "output-container," "output-header," and "output-content." That sounds good! 

After completing the patch, I also want to consider allowing the "monaco view" to run code when Ctrl+Enter is pressed, as that’s already handled. I’ll verify in `Notebook.tsx` that we're setting outputs properly after executing the JavaScript. Time to implement these updates!</details></think>

- Cause: We were returning the JS value but only showed outputs when “Output” mode was selected, and the JS return wasn’t rendered as a clear visual block.

- Fixes done:
  - Always render outputs below a cell if present (no need to switch to “Output” mode) in `view/src/components/Cell/Cell.tsx`.
  - For JS cells, after execution we now add two outputs in `view/src/components/Notebook/Notebook.tsx`:
    - A human-readable text line: “Return value: <value>”
    - The structured output: the returned value as `json` (or `error`)
  - This ensures the return is dedicated and visible right under the cell.

- What to try:
  - Run your code again:
    ```
    const numero = prompt("Digite um número:");
    const numeroConvertido = Number(numero);
    const resultado = numeroConvertido * 2;
    return resultado;
    ```
  - After you submit the prompt, you should immediately see:
    - “Return value: <n>”
    - The JSON block with the numeric value

If you want this “return” block styled differently or separated like a distinct mini-cell, I can add a divider and a small header.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating README for implementations**

I need to update the README with our latest implementations. We've added a plan to plans/gencode.md and implemented several features, like capturing JS return and output visualizations. Our dev instructions indicate I should edit the README to reflect these changes. Even though it's a single edit, the spec suggests using the todo list for multi-step tasks. I'm pondering skipping it since we closed previous todos. I’ll modify the README.md accordingly with concise status updates as needed!
**Editing the README for updates**

For this new goal, I can directly edit the file while making sure to preserve indentation since the README uses spaces at the start of lines, which is typical for Markdown. I’m thinking of adding a new section called "What's New" or updating the Features and Execution sections to highlight recent changes. I want to avoid heavy code blocks unless absolutely necessary, but I’ll include some code examples since they’re already part of the README. Let's get this done!
**Implementing README changes**

I’m ready to craft the changes for the README! I’ll update the Features section to include "Return capture and chaining via env.getCellOutput" and "Run Markdown with AI to generate JS". I’ll also add a "Notebook Execution Model" section that describes JS return capture and output settings. Updating the architecture involves clarifying how the AI RUN triggers the RUN_CELL tool. Additionally, I’ll include a quick example for writing a JS cell and possibly mention genId. I’ll also consider updating the RPC snippet. Let’s go ahead and apply the patch!</details></think>
