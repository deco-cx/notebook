Now I have a good understanding of the project. This is **Deco Studio** - a sophisticated notebook-based development environment that combines MCP (Model Context Protocol) server capabilities with a React frontend. It's essentially a coding notebook system with AI integration, similar to Jupyter but with more advanced features. Let me update the README to accurately reflect what this project actually is:

- ## 🔗 Frontend ↔ Server Communication
- 
- The template includes a fully-typed RPC client that connects your React frontend
- to your MCP server:
- 
+ ## 🔗 Architecture & Communication
+ 
+ Deco Studio uses a sophisticated architecture that combines notebook management, AI integration, and extensible view systems:
+ 
+ ### Cell Types & Execution
+ - **JavaScript/Python**: Code cells with live execution and output capture
+ - **Markdown**: Rich text editing with TipTap editor
+ - **HTML/JSON**: Structured content with syntax highlighting
+ - **Excalidraw**: Interactive diagram and drawing capabilities
+ - **Workflow**: MCP workflow integration for AI-powered automation
+ 
+ ### View Apps System
+ The notebook supports pluggable view applications for different cell types:
+ ```typescript
+ // Example: Monaco editor for code cells
+ const monacoView: ViewApp = {
+   id: "monaco",
+   name: "Code Editor",
+   supportedTypes: ["javascript", "python", "json"],
+   component: MonacoView,
+   config: { canEdit: true, canExecute: true }
+ };
+ ```
+ 
+ ### RPC Communication
+ Fully-typed RPC client connects the React frontend to MCP server tools:
  ```typescript
- // Typed calls to your server tools and workflows
- const result = await client.MY_TOOL({ input: "data" });
- const workflowResult = await client.MY_WORKFLOW({ input: "data" });
+ // Notebook operations
+ const notebooks = await client.LIST_NOTEBOOKS();
+ await client.CREATE_CELL({ notebookId, type: "javascript", content: "console.log('Hello!')" });
+ 
+ // Tool execution
+ const result = await client.EXECUTE_TOOL({ toolName: "MY_TOOL", args: { input: "data" } });
  ```

+ ## 🚀 Key Use Cases
+ 
+ - **Interactive Development**: Write and execute code in multiple languages with live feedback
+ - **AI-Powered Workflows**: Create sophisticated automation using MCP tools and AI integration
+ - **Data Analysis**: Combine code execution, visualizations, and rich documentation in one place
+ - **Collaborative Notebooks**: Share and collaborate on interactive documents with embedded code and outputs
+ - **Prototyping**: Rapidly prototype ideas with mixed content types (code, diagrams, documentation)
+ 
+ ## 🔧 Extending the System
+ 
+ ### Adding New Cell Types
+ ```typescript
+ // Define new cell type in types/notebook.ts
+ export type CellType = "markdown" | "javascript" | "python" | "mycustomtype";
+ 
+ // Create corresponding view app
+ const customView: ViewApp = {
+   id: "custom",
+   name: "Custom View",
+   supportedTypes: ["mycustomtype"],
+   component: MyCustomComponent
+ };
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Creating MCP Tools
+ ```typescript
+ // Add tools in server/tools/ directory
+ export const createMyTool = (env: Env) => createTool({
+   id: "MY_TOOL",
+   description: "Custom tool description",
+   inputSchema: z.object({ input: z.string() }),
+   outputSchema: z.object({ result: z.string() }),
+   execute: async ({ context }) => {
+     // Tool implementation
+     return { result: `Processed: ${context.input}` };

+ });

Perfect! I've successfully updated the README.md and related files to accurately reflect what Deco Studio actually is. Here's a summary of the changes I made:

## Updated README.md

**Key Changes:**
1. **Project Name & Description**: Changed from "Deco MCP template app" to "Deco Studio" - a powerful notebook-based development environment
2. **Features Section**: Updated to highlight notebook-specific features like:
   - Interactive notebooks with multiple cell types
   - Multi-language support (JavaScript, Python, etc.)
   - Rich visualizations and extensible view system
   - Real-time execution with output capture
   - Persistent SQLite storage

3. **Project Structure**: Updated to show the actual structure with:
   - Server tools organized by domain (notebook.ts, todos.ts, user.ts)
   - View components for notebook interface
   - Database schema and utilities

4. **Architecture Section**: Added comprehensive explanation of:
   - Cell types and execution model
   - View apps system with pluggable components
   - RPC communication patterns specific to notebooks

5. **Use Cases**: Added relevant use cases like interactive development, AI-powered workflows, data analysis, and collaborative notebooks

6. **Extension Guide**: Added examples for creating new cell types and MCP tools

## Updated HTML & Manifest

**SEO & Metadata Updates:**
- **Title**: Changed to "Deco Studio - AI-Powered Notebook Environment"
- **Meta Description**: Updated to accurately describe the notebook-based development environment
- **PWA Manifest**: Updated app name and short name to "Deco Studio"

The README now accurately represents Deco Studio as a sophisticated notebook-based development environment that combines:
- Interactive coding cells (JavaScript, Python, Markdown, HTML, JSON, Excalidraw, Workflows)
- AI integration through MCP protocol
- Extensible view system for different content types
- Real-time execution and output capture
- Persistent storage and collaboration features

This is much more accurate than the previous generic "MCP template app" description and properly showcases the unique capabilities of this notebook-based development platform.
