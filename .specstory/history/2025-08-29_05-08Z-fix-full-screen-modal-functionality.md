# Fix full screen modal functionality (2025-08-29 05:08Z)

_**User**_

The full screen doesn't appear to be working. It makes the height larget, but it should open a modal with the app in almost entire full screen, only with a top bar with the breadcrumbs and x icon

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting full screen issue**

I need to address the problem where the full screen feature isn't working as intended. Instead of just increasing the height, it should open a modal that occupies almost the entire screen, leaving a top bar with breadcrumbs and an X icon. The component ‘ExcalidrawView.tsx’ was recently modified, as well as other files like ‘Cell.tsx’ and ‘Notebook.tsx’. I need to inspect the code to see how the full screen state is toggled and search the codebase for clarity.
**Planning for full screen implementation**

I’m recognizing that the `codebase_search` function is semantic but I can also read the relevant files directly. First, I'll look into the content of `ExcalidrawView.tsx`, `Cell.tsx`, and `Notebook.tsx`. I want to take into account any utilities or hooks related to the full screen feature. I'll run these reads in parallel and follow up with status updates as needed. I should also create a TODO list for this UI change since it involves multiple steps, like implementing the modal overlay and integrating components. Let's move forward!</details></think>

I'll scan the relevant view and container components to see how fullscreen is currently implemented and where to hook in a modal overlay with a top bar and close action. Then I'll add a modal-based fullscreen implementation and wire it to the existing fullscreen trigger.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Examining full screen implementation**

I need to implement the "full screen" behavior where a modal opens, covering almost the entire screen. It should include a top bar with breadcrumbs and an X icon. Currently, the views accept a prop called isFullscreen, and ExcalidrawView and IframeView use it for height and UIOptions, but they’re not opening a modal overlay. I think the ViewWrapper might be responsible for toggling full screen but is only enlarging the height right now. I'll check the ViewWrapper.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Designing a fullscreen experience**

I need to set up a modal fullscreen experience that includes a top bar with breadcrumbs and an X icon, rather than just increasing the height. Currently, the fullscreen behavior in ViewWrapper toggles a class for a fixed layout, but it lacks the structured header needed for a modal. The user pointed out that while the height increases, it isn't opening a modal as expected. So, I’ll prioritize creating the structured layout that the user is looking for.
**Modifying ViewWrapper for full screen**

I need to adjust ViewWrapper to display a modal overlay when fullscreen is activated. The modal should take up almost the entire screen while keeping a top bar visible. This top bar will feature breadcrumbs, which could be derived from selectedView.name and cell ID, possibly using notebook paths. It might be easier to create a top bar like "Notebook / Cell 003 / View: Excalidraw" directly in ViewWrapper. I plan to use React's `createPortal` to render the modal overlay at document.body when fullscreen is true.
**Implementing modal content in React**

For a Vite React app, I can use react-dom to implement the modal. The modal content will be styled with classes like fixed inset-0 z-50 flex flex-col bg-gray-900/95 with a backdrop-blur effect. The top bar will be about `h-12` or `py-2`, displaying breadcrumbs from cell metadata, such as `cell.id`, `selectedView.name`, and possibly `cell.type`. I’ll add a close button featuring the X icon from lucide-react. 

For the content container, I want to maintain the file's indentation style—I'm still figuring out if it uses tabs or spaces, as `Cell.tsx` shows two spaces. I’ll be cautious to preserve the existing style.
**Determining indentation style**

It seems that the tokens indicate tabs for indentation, especially at the start of lines within functions like "export function ViewWrapper({"—the line numbers also reflect a tab indentation on the following lines. Since there’s some uncertainty about the current indentation style, it's crucial to match the code I add with the existing format. The '	' representation might be tricky, but there appears to be consistency in using tabs across other files as well. So, I'll make sure to maintain tabs in my code.
**Implementing fullscreen modal functionality**

I plan to keep the local `isFullscreen` state as before, but instead of applying the fixed inset-0 class to the wrapper, I’ll render the modal via a portal while having a minimal placeholder in the wrapper. I’ll introduce a `renderedView` variable to return the `<ViewComponent ...>`. 

When fullscreen is activated, instead of rendering the usual layout, I’ll show a fragment with a small placeholder but still include the toggle button. I’ll ensure that ExcalidrawView correctly adjusts its height by changing from `h-screen` to `h-full` when in fullscreen, aiming for consistency across views. 

I also want to ensure the breadcrumbs are formatted correctly and maintain aria roles for accessibility. Additionally, I'll adjust the CSS styles using Tailwind classes and check the types to make sure `onToggleFullscreen` is correctly defined.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reviewing toggle functionality**

I need to make sure that the toggle button properly triggers the modal. Right now, the overlay class uses specific positioning that covers the entire screen, but doesn’t seem to function as intended. The user's feedback suggests the height just increases without achieving the modal effect. It could be an issue with the `ViewWrapper` being embedded within the cell tree or concerns with the overlay not properly covering due to parent overflow in Notebook styles. Let’s explore this further!
**Designing a proper modal**

I want to implement a proper modal that features a fixed overlay covering the viewport, complete with a top bar for breadcrumbs and a close button. The view content will use an absolute/relative layout, and I'll ensure we have a background overlay of `bg-black/80`. 

In the `ViewWrapper`, when `isFullscreen` is true, I'm considering using React's `createPortal` to render the modal in the body, which would help escape parent stacking contexts. I’ll add the necessary import and maintain the coding style throughout.
**Adding a top bar**

I need to add a top bar for the modal. It should have a fixed position at the top, featuring a header that contains breadcrumbs on the left and a close button on the right. Below the header, the content area should be styled appropriately, utilizing the `ViewComponent` within a padded container.

The breadcrumbs could display in a format like `NOTEBOOK / CELL_{id} / {selectedView.name}` while hiding the maximize/minimize button in fullscreen mode. I’ll also make adjustments in `ExcalidrawView.tsx` and `IframeView.tsx` to ensure proper height filling without overlaps.
**Adjusting modal content heights**

In the content area of the modal, I need to change the height from `h-screen` to something more suitable, especially since the header takes up 48px. If `Excalidraw` uses `h-screen`, it will cause overflow, so I’ll update that to `h-full` when `isFullscreen` is true.

For `IframeView`, I’ll change the height to `h-full` and adjust padding accordingly. I'll also make sure to include breadcrumbs that display the path nicely.

Let’s implement these updates to ensure everything works smoothly for the modal!
**Integrating the X icon**

I need to integrate the X icon into the `ViewWrapper`, and it seems we should use the `lucide-react` package if it's already imported. Currently, I’m using `Maximize2` and `Minimize2`, and I’ll also bring in the X icon. For breadcrumbs, I think slashes or simple text like '›' works fine.

I'll make sure that the `onToggleFullscreen` function is still passing correctly, and I’ll implement these code changes using `apply_patch`. Updating CSS might not be necessary. Let’s go ahead and make these adjustments!</details></think>

I'll implement a modal-based fullscreen: update `ViewWrapper` to render a portal with an overlay, top bar (breadcrumbs + close), and a content area that fills the viewport minus the top bar. I'll also adjust `ExcalidrawView` and `IframeView` so that in fullscreen they use `h-full` to fit the modal container rather than `h-screen`.

- I inspected the view wrapper and the view components. I’m implementing fullscreen via a modal overlay instead of just stretching height.

What I changed:
- View wrapper now uses a portal-based modal for fullscreen with backdrop and a top bar.
- Added breadcrumbs-style title and a close (X) button in the top bar.
- Moved the fullscreen button logic: inline view shows a Maximize button; the modal has a Close action.
- `ExcalidrawView` and `IframeView` now use `h-full` in fullscreen to fit the modal content area instead of `h-screen`.

How it works:
- Click the Maximize button on hover to open modal.
- The modal shows a top bar with breadcrumb-like text: NOTEBOOK / CELL_<id> / <ViewName> and an X button to exit.
- Content fills the remaining viewport below the top bar.

- Let me know if you want the breadcrumb to show the actual notebook path; I can pull it in if it’s available in context.
