# 9) Definition of Done (DoD)

## Feature Completion Criteria:

### ✅ Installable App with Onboarding:
- **Default Experience**: Logged-out users see onboarding notebook with welcome content and runnable JavaScript example
- **Authentication Modal**: AI features trigger modal explaining deco app with $2 free credits mention
- **OAuth Integration**: Users can login via `/oauth/start` and access their workspace tools
- **Database Persistence**: Complete SQLite schema with Drizzle ORM, CRUD operations, and migrations
- **Note Navigation**: Searchable note selector in topbar with daily notes, regular notes, and templates
- **Daily Notes**: Auto-creation and URL routing to today's note by default
- **User Interface**: Workspace name and email display in topbar when logged in

### ✅ Agent (AI SDK 5):
- **Streaming Route**: `/stream` route functional with `streamText`, `useChat`, `onToolCall` real-time and Anthropic API key
- **Tool Integration**: Agent can modify notebook cells (add/edit/delete) during conversation
- **Real-time Updates**: Tool calls execute immediately and update notebook UI
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Context Awareness**: Agent understands current notebook state and provides relevant suggestions

### ✅ Dynamic Tool Calls:
- **Automatic Discovery**: Discovery via direct JSON-RPC fetch to MCP integrations (replaces `availableTools.ts`)
- **Tool Execution**: `DYNAMIC_TOOL_CALL` executes specific tools with validated input
- **Integration Coverage**: System discovers and uses tools from all workspace integrations
- **Caching**: Tool discovery results cached for performance
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of offline/inaccessible integrations

### ✅ HTML View:
- **Secure Rendering**: HTML renders with `window.callTool()` for env access (similar to JavaScript cells)
- **Tool Access**: HTML scripts can call workspace tools via fetch API
- **XSS Protection**: DOMPurify sanitization prevents malicious content execution
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Support for Chart.js, D3.js, and custom interactive elements

### ✅ Shortcuts and Templates:
- **Slash Commands**: "/" opens menu with cell insertion and template options
- **Mentions**: "@" inserts variable mentions with autocomplete
- **Templates**: Template system working with "Create Microsaas" and other pre-built templates
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All shortcuts work consistently across different views
- **Template Insertion**: Templates create multiple cells with proper content and views
