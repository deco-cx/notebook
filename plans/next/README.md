# Next Plan: Make App Installable, Agent, Dynamic Tool Calls, HTML View and Shortcuts

This plan describes an objective path, in executable steps, to:
- Make the app installable with complete onboarding experience
- Create/expand an Agent
- Enable Dynamic Tool Calls
- Create an HTML View
- Implement shortcuts with "/" and mentions with "@" (including template insertion like "Create Microsaas")

Each topic contains: objectives, deliverables, technical steps, file changes, packages, acceptance criteria and risks.

## Plan Structure

This plan is split into focused files:

1. **[01-installable-app.md](./01-installable-app.md)** - Complete onboarding experience with authentication, database persistence, and note navigation
2. **[02-agent.md](./02-agent.md)** - AI agent implementation with chat interface and tool calling
3. **[03-dynamic-tools.md](./03-dynamic-tools.md)** - Dynamic tool discovery and execution system
4. **[04-html-view.md](./04-html-view.md)** - HTML view with environment access for interactive dashboards
5. **[05-shortcuts.md](./05-shortcuts.md)** - Slash commands, mentions, and template insertion
6. **[06-timeline.md](./06-timeline.md)** - Implementation timeline and dependencies
7. **[07-testing.md](./07-testing.md)** - Testing strategy and QA requirements
8. **[08-deployment.md](./08-deployment.md)** - Commands, dependencies, and deployment guide

## Quick Start

1. Review [01-installable-app.md](./01-installable-app.md) for the foundational onboarding experience
2. Check [06-timeline.md](./06-timeline.md) for implementation sequence
3. Follow [08-deployment.md](./08-deployment.md) for setup commands

Each file is self-contained with complete implementation details, code examples, and acceptance criteria.
